# Password Generator

## Description
This webiste allows you to generate a random password with whatever criteria you want. This webiste allows you to select how long you would like your password to be and it allows you to choose whether or not you would like to inclue uppercase, lowercase, special characters and/or numbers. You can do this as many times as you would like. 

While creating the JavaScript for this website, I learned about for loops, variables, if/else statements and functions.
